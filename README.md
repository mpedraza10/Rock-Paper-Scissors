# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Python game project. This is a classic rock ,paper, scissor game where I code and practice my abilities using global variables, functions, loops, validation
and a module. I intend to keep upgrading this project and add more functionality and even an interface. 

INSTRUCTIONS: Type rock, paper or scissors and try to beat the computer. Good luck! (Remember whoever wins 3 rounds first will win the game!)
